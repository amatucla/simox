# Simox

Simon, the classic electronic game of memory skill now for Firefox OS devices.

Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.

## Gameplay

The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

## Features

  - Cool graphics and audio effects.
  - Not the first for Firefox OS Plattform, but maybe the best version so far.
